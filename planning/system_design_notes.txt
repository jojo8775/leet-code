Notes for system design: 

Chapter1 

- Non-relational DB
	- NeoJS, Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase, Amazon Dynamo DB 
		- Key Value 
		- Graph 
		- Object / document / file Store 
		- column store 

	Adv 
		- low latency 
		- unstructured data 
		- serialize / deserialized data --- XML, JSON, 
		- massive amount of data 
		

Capter 4 : 

- Ratelimiter 
	Alog: 
		Token Bucket:
			Tokens are filled at a regular interval 
				- Not good for traffic spike as it will make the service unavailable 
				- Since all the tokens are available at the initial state, it will allow a burst of requests to the server 

		Leaky Bucket: 
			: Creates a small queue and put the requests in the queue. The other side of the queue a worker process the queue at a regular speed 
				- Not good for spike traffic because we may have a stale request in the queue. 

		Sliding Window: 
			: Similar logic to token bucker but base of time series. A specific number of tokens are assigned at every internal 
				- It may allow more than the threshold request (at most 2x)

		Sliding Window counter:
			: usses a log mechanism and invalidates the previous timestamp which are before the begining of the current rolling window 
				- it registers even for the rejected calls 
				- memory intensive
