Hi Melissa, 

I came across this position on LinkedIn and it caught my interest. I am currently located in Vancouver working for Microsoft. I have 8+ years of experience in restful online service development following Agile methodology. Most of the web services I have developed are fault-tolerant and cater to large-scale data with high availability and minimum latency. I have extensive experience working with a wide range of tech stack such as Java, Jenkins, C#, Redis cache, Azure Cloud services, No SQL Cosmos DB, and relational databases. I have handled end-to-end project delivery, starting from requirement gathering, system design, implementation, and deployment using a continuous integration environment such as Azure Pipelines. 

Additionally, as a team lead, I have mentored developers and collaborated across teams, to deliver quality code and provide risk mitigation for on-time project delivery. Based on your job requirement I have the technical expertise and soft skills which I believe would be critical to succeed in this role. I am sharing my resume and I hope to get in touch with you soon.
